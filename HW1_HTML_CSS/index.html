        <h1>Xbox Underground</h1>

        <p>
        Xbox Underground was a hacking group that emerged during the early Xbox 
        hacking scene in the 2000s. What began as console exploitation/modifications 
        evolved into one of the most significant cybercriminal operations targeting 
        the gaming industry. 
        </p>

        <h2>What Happened?</h2>
        <p>
           The group initially focused on Xbox console hacking and modding, but their 
           activities escalated dramatically over time. They gained unauthorized access to 
           multiple major technology and gaming companies, including Microsoft, Sony, 
           Epic Games, Valve, and others. Their breaches involved stealing unreleased games, 
           source code, and proprietary development tools, causing millions of dollars in 
           damages to the gaming industry.
        </p>

        <h2>Impact on Cybersecurity</h2>
        <p>
           This case demonstrates how seemingly innocent console modding communities can 
           evolve into sophisticated cybercriminal operations. It also showcased vulnerabilities 
           in the gaming industry's security practices and led to improved security measures 
           across major gaming companies.
